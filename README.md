# Patterns
A collection of data acquisition and analysis tools for experimental data on pattern forming particles in oscillating flows.

Organisational additions such as creation of subdirectories or changing file dependencies will be done from the 'organisation' branch.

Data used for example or validation purposes is stored in the 'data' directory. Analysis scripts will be created and developed in the 'analysis/validation' directory. Once a working version is obtained it will be copied/adapted/transfered to 'analysis/final'.
